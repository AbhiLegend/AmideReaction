## What is the purpose
Visualization of Chemical Structures: The application allows users to enter SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings, which are text-based representations of chemical structures. The code then uses the RDKit library to convert these strings into visual representations of the corresponding molecular structures. This feature is crucial for understanding and analyzing the molecular composition and layout of chemical compounds.

Demonstration of Amide Coupling Reaction: The core functionality of the app is to simulate an amide coupling reaction, a fundamental chemical reaction in organic synthesis. This reaction typically involves the formation of an amide bond between a carboxylic acid and an amine. The app allows users to input SMILES strings for both a carboxylic acid and an amine.

Chemical Reaction Simulation and Visualization: After the user inputs the SMILES strings for the two reactants (a carboxylic acid and an amine), the app uses RDKit to simulate the amide coupling reaction. It generates the SMILES strings of the product(s) of this reaction. These product strings are then converted back into visual representations, allowing users to see the outcome of the chemical reaction.

Educational Tool: The app serves as an educational tool for students and researchers in chemistry. By providing a visual representation of molecules and their reactions, it helps in better understanding complex chemical processes. Users can experiment with different combinations of reactants to observe various outcomes, which can be a powerful way to learn about chemical reactivity and molecular structure.

Research and Experimentation: For researchers in the field, the app can be a quick and easy tool to visualize the potential outcomes of amide coupling reactions without the need for actual laboratory experiments. It can aid in hypothesis formation, reaction planning, and understanding molecular interactions in organic synthesis.

In summary, this Streamlit application is designed to provide a user-friendly, interactive platform for visualizing molecular structures and simulating amide coupling reactions, serving as a valuable resource for both educational and research purposes in the field of chemistry.
